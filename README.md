# OktaRBAC

# 🔐 Okta IAM Analyst Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a hands-on exploration of **Okta Identity and Access Management (IAM)** fundamentals. The purpose of this project was to better understand **what Okta is**, how it’s used, and how it integrates with technologies I might encounter in an IAM Analyst role — particularly as a complement to my SC-300 Microsoft Entra ID studies.

While my focus is shifting back to Azure for now, this repo documents the foundational work I completed and reflects the early stages of building **intuition around Okta’s workflows and structure**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand Okta's role in cloud-based IAM
- Simulate basic **user provisioning and access control**
- Explore **role-based access (RBAC)** using `app_metadata`
- Begin testing **application integration** and **token customization**

## ✅ What I Did

- [x] Created an **Okta Developer tenant**
- [x] Added test users (e.g., IT Admin, HR Staff, Sales Rep)
- [x] Configured `app_metadata` for user roles
- [x] Created a custom **Auth0 Rule** to inject roles into ID tokens (for access control)
- [x] Explored sample app integration with Okta (PHP & Node concepts)
- [x] Experienced hands-on trial-and-error (deleting & rebuilding configurations)
